# Covid-Data-Analysis

1. Data Loading and Inspection:
    - Load the COVID-19 data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
    - Display the first few rows of the DataFrame to understand the structure of the data.
    - Check the data types and missing values in the DataFrame to ensure data integrity.

2. Data Preprocessing:
    - Convert the 'Date' column to datetime format for easy manipulation of temporal data.
    - Compute basic statistics of the dataset, including count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, etc.

3. Total Cases, Deaths, and Recoveries Over Time:
    - Group the data by date and calculate the total confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
    - Plot the total cases, deaths, and recoveries over time to visualize the progression of the pandemic.

4. Daily New Cases:
    - Calculate the daily new cases by taking the difference in confirmed cases between consecutive days.
    - Plot the daily new cases over time to observe the trends in new infections.

5. Total Cases, Deaths, and Recoveries by Continent:
    - Group the data by continent and aggregate the total confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
    - Plot stacked bar charts to compare the COVID-19 statistics across different continents.

6. Top 10 Countries by Total COVID-19 Cases:
    - Group the data by country and extract the maximum confirmed cases for each country.
    - Select the top 10 countries with the highest total confirmed cases and plot them in a bar chart.

7. Correlation Matrix:
    - Compute the correlation matrix of the COVID-19 data to understand the relationships between different variables.
    - Visualize the correlation matrix using a heatmap to identify any patterns or dependencies.

8. Monthly COVID-19 Trends:
    - Extract the month from the 'Date' column and aggregate the total confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for each month.
    - Plot stacked bar charts to analyze the monthly trends in COVID-19 statistics.

9. COVID-19 Fatality Rate Over Time:
    - Calculate the fatality rate (deaths / confirmed cases) over time.
    - Plot the fatality rate over time to understand the mortality trend of the disease.

10. 7-Day Moving Average of Daily New Cases:
    - Compute the 7-day moving average of daily new cases to smooth out fluctuations and identify trends.
    - Plot the moving average of new cases over time to visualize the trend in infection rates.

11. COVID-19 Growth Rate Over Time:
    - Calculate the percentage change in confirmed cases compared to the previous day to determine the growth rate.
    - Plot the growth rate of COVID-19 cases over time to understand the rate of spread of the virus.

12. Exponential Growth Phase Detection:
    - Define a threshold for identifying the exponential growth phase based on the growth rate.
    - Identify the dates where the growth rate exceeds the threshold and mark them on the plot to detect exponential growth phases.
